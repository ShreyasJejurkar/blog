Hello Everyone.I am Shreyas. Today I am telling one of the trick OR hack by which you can *access Recycle Bin from My Computer* itself.  
So just follow the steps. And refer screenshot for help.  
1\. Press <u>“Windows Logo Key+R” </u>simultaneously. When “Run” dialog box open type “regedit” in that and hit enter.  
2\. This will open up the Windows Registry Editor.  
3\. In Registry editor navigate to this path.

> HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\MyComputer\\NameSpace

4\. Right click on NameSpace and click on New &gt; Key. (be careful while doing this)  
5\. And rename the key as following

> {645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}

6\. After that close the registry and open the “My Computer”. You will see there a Recycle Bin and you get easily access from “My Computer” itself.  
isn’t it useful?
