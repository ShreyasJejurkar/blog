Programming on Ubuntu has many advantages than on doing it on Windows. Because Ubuntu sports a many programming language compilers out of the box and there is no need to install them additionally. I am not saying Ubuntu is better than Windows but while in some cases it is. And Microsoft knows this and that’s why Microsoft allows you to run Linux bash shell inside in Windows 10 Anniversary update (14393). But today’s post is not about that.  
In today’s post, I am going to show you how you can easily set up Ubuntu as guest OS in VirtualBox. But first, a fall What is VirtualBox?  
**What is VirtualBox?** VirtualBox is the product of Oracle company which allows you to run an entire operating system inside another operating system.  
**Requirement** To install Ubuntu on VirtualBox you will, of course, need a VirtualBox software. And one more thing Ubuntu ISO file for installation. You can download both of them from following links. And also I will suggest installing VM if you have at least 4 GB of RAM.

[Download VirtualBox ](http://filehippo.com/download_virtualbox/)

[Download Ubuntu ISO ](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

**Installation Steps**

1\. Install Oracle VirtualBox software on your system. Double click on setup file you downloaded previously to start the installation. While installing, setup will ask you to install some additional drivers on your system at that time click on install (it’s safe to install).

2\. After installation VirtualBox will start automatically. If not, then double click on the shortcut to start it.  
3.Then in VirtualBox application click on ‘New’ on left upper corner to set up a new machine.

4\. After you click name your Virtual Machine you can name it whatever you want in my case I am simply naming it to ‘Ubuntu’. After you name it to click on next button.  
5\. On next window, it will ask you how much maximum RAM your virtual machine can use from your actual RAM.

6\. This is different for the different user as per their RAM on their machine. It’s recommended to have minimum 2 GB of RAM on your machine to use Virtual Machine. And now a day everyone has at least 4 GB of RAM on their machine so not a problem at all. My suggestion is if you have 4 GB of RAM then give 2 GB (2048 MB) RAM to your virtual machine if you have 8 GB of RAM then you can give (3.5 to 4 GB) RAM to your virtual machine. Note that this is maximum RAM.  
7\. After your setup RAM for your machine click on next button then click on next, next then create and then finish.
