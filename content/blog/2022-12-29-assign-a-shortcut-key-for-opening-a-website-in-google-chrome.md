Have you ever wished you could quickly open your favorite website with just a few keystrokes? Well, you can! Chrome allows you to assign shortcut keys for opening websites, making it easy to access them without having to manually type in the URL or click on a bookmark. Here’s how to do it:

1. Open Chrome and navigate to the website you want to create a shortcut for.
2. In the address bar, click on the icon to the left of the website’s URL.
3. Drag the icon to your desktop or to the location where you want to create the shortcut.
4. A dialog box will appear asking if you want to create a shortcut. Click on “Create” to create the shortcut.
5. Right-click on the newly created shortcut and select “Properties” from the context menu.
6. In the Properties window, click on the “Shortcut” tab.
7. In the “Shortcut key” field, press the key combination you want to use as the shortcut. For example, if you want to use the “Ctrl+Shift+W” combination, press and hold the Ctrl and Shift keys, and then press the W key.
8. Click on “Apply” and then “OK” to save your changes.

Now, whenever you want to open the website, you can use the shortcut key combination you assigned to open it in Chrome. This can be a real time-saver if you frequently visit the same websites and want to access them quickly.

To use the shortcut key, simply press and hold the keys you assigned as the shortcut (e.g. Ctrl and Shift, in the example above) and then press the final key (e.g. W, in the example above). The website will open in a new tab in Chrome.
