Recently VMWare announced they are making VMWare Workstation Pro FREE for personal use. The VMWare workstation was already good virtualization software, I was using it to try out new operating systems or new Linux flavors instead of taking the hard pathway of dual-booting operating systems. It's a handy tool to quickly spin up another machine without having it. ðŸ˜‰ And now pro is free to use for personal use, it unlocks whole new level of customization.

But downloading VMWare Workstation Pro is a pain. It's behind Broadcom and needs an account there to download the software. And again we need to search the actual download page to download the software. 

But in this quick blog post, I will share a direct download link for downloading VMWare Workstation Pro without needing to go to Broadcom and create an account.
